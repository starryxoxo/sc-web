# Mendelian Genetics

<div style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-bottom: -18px;">father of genetics</div>

## Gregor Mendel
-> In **1866**, Gregor Johann Mendel, an **Austrian monk**, began experimenting with pea plants (Pisum sativum) to study how traits are inherited.
-> His work with self-fertilization and cross-pollination allowed him to discover patterns in inheritance.

### Genetics
Genetics is the **study** of **how genes determine traits** and **how** these **traits are passed down** from one generation to the next.

### Heredity 
Heredity is the **transfer** or **passing of traits from parents to offspring** (one generation to another generation.

| Genes           | A gene **controls** a specific trait.                                           |
| Alleles         | Alleles are **different versions** of genes.                                    |
| Dominant trait  | Traits that will **always show up** in an organism's appearance **if present**. |
| Recessive trait | Traits that appear **only when both alleles are recessive**.                    |

## Homozygous vs Heterozygous
-> **Heterozygous** means **different alleles** (For example, Yy). A heterozygous genotype will always be a dominant trait, because it has a dominant allele.
-> **Homozygous** means **same alleles** (For example, YY, yy). A homozygous genotype can be both dominant and recessive, depending on the allele.

## Genotype
A genotype is **an organism's genetic makeup**, and the combination of alleles it has for a trait. **Represents the genes** (letters).

## Phenotype
A phenotype is **the physical characteristic** that results from the genotype.

# Laws of Heredity

## 1. Law of Dominance
This law suggests that if two alleles are present in a gene, *one will become dominant* and the other will be recessive. **The dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele**.

## 2. Law of Segregation
This law states that an organism has each two alleles, **one from each parent**.

## 3. Law of Independent Assortment
This law says that a trait is passed independently, as long as the genes are on different chromosomes.
