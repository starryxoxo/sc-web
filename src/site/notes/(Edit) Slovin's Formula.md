# Slovin's Formula

>[!warning]- a1: Please clarify and edit this section.
>Text needs clarity and needs more focus. 

The Slovin's Formula is a simple mathematical formula used to calculate the required sample size of a study.

$$ n = \frac {N}{1+Ne^2} $$
Where $n$ is the sample size, $N$ is the total population size, and $e$ being the margin of error (expressed as a decimal).

# Guide

What is the sample size required for a population of 5000 and the margin of error is set as 3%?
 • First, we identify the total population size of the situation. $N$ here is $5000$.
 • Second, we identify the desired margin of error. $e$ is set as $3\%$.
 • Third, we substitute our values to the variables in our formula.

Our current equation is:
$$ n = \frac {5000}{{1+5000} ×{3\%^2}}$$
Now, we simplify the equation.
$$n = \frac {5000}{1+5000×0.03^2}$$
$$n = \frac {5000}{1+5000×0.0009}$$
$$5000×0.0009=4.5+1=5.5$$
$$n = \frac {5000}{5.5}$$
$$n = 909.0909$$

or simply, $909.10 = 909$.
