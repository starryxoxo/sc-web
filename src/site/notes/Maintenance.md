## Learn more about SC Web maintenance



| SC Web periodically goes maintenance mode during 11:01PM to 5:59AM. What this means for you:                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slower loading times** <br>The website can load for ~15 seconds to 1 minute.                                                                            |
| **After the website is loaded**, all requests (meaning **for other users**), it will be **faster**.                                                       |
| **Usually, only the first load is affected.** There is a **15-minute window** until the **next slow loading time**.                                       |
| SC Web is **not perfect**. Loading times can still slow down even if **not during maintenance mode**, especially if use has been heavy for the last hour. |
