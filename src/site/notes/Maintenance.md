## Learn more about SC Web maintenance

| SC Web periodically undergoes maintenance mode from 10:01PM to 8:59AM. What this means for you:                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slower loading times** <br>The website can load for ~15 seconds to 1 minute.                                            |
| **After the website is loaded**, all requests **from other users onwards** will be **faster**.                            |
| **Usually, only the first load is affected.** There is a **15-minute window** until the **next slow loading time**.       |
| SC Web is **not perfect**. Loading times can still slow down even if **not during maintenance mode**.                     |
| If you're using the [legacy version](https://scweb9.netlify.app/), you will **not** be affected by the slow loading time. |
