Slovin's Formula

The Slovin's Formula is a simple mathematical formula used to calculate the required sample size of a study. Test

𝑛
=
𝑁
1
+
𝑁
𝑒
2

Where 
𝑛
 is the sample size, 
𝑁
 is the total population size, and 
𝑒
 being the margin of error (expressed as a decimal).

Guide

What is the sample size required for a population of 5000 and the margin of error is set as 3%?
• First, we identify the total population size of the situation. 
𝑁
 here is 
5000
.
• Second, we identify the desired margin of error. 
𝑒
 is set as 
3
%
.
• Third, we substitute our values to the variables in our formula.

Our current equation is:

𝑛
=
5000
1
+
5000
×
3

Now, we simplify the equation.

0.0009
=

=
5.5

𝑛
=
5000
5.5

𝑛
=
909.0909

or simply, 
909.10
=
909
.

Whether the final answer will be rounded depends on the situation. It is recommended to round up to the nearest whole number.
